I use Singleton and Observer pattern mostly because game is small and simple. 
In soldier scripts code is can be improved because i use nlayer architecture(Movement, Health and Attack).
For example soldier move with navmesh agent if we want to change with a* path finding asset we need to create MoveAStartDal
and change with MoveNavMeshDal that simple we can change our codes.
